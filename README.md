# 42-Piscine
I participated in the "piscine" event at 42 Ecole and completed projects from C00 to C08. 
These projects helped me enhance my fundamental programming skills in C. Additionally, I worked on the Shell00 project, improving my command line skills. 
Throughout this process, I developed my coding and problem-solving abilities. Overall, this experience was very educational and enjoyable.
